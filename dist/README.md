## ðŸ“¦ APK & Submission Notes

### ðŸ”¹ Debug APK Provided
- This submission includes a **Debug APK** instead of a Release APK.  
- **Reason:**  
  1. **Google Maps API Key** is securely stored in `local.properties` for development.  
  2. **Directions API** is integrated via **Android environment variables**, which may not work in a signed Release build without additional setup.  
  3. **Debug builds** ensure the Directions API works seamlessly during testing.  
  4. **Debug APK size** is larger than release builds because of additional debug symbols.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Third-Party Directions API
- **API Used:** `https://maps.gomaps.pro/maps/api/directions/json`  
- **Why Used:**  
  1. Official **Google Directions API** is **paid** and requires billing.  
  2. This free, third-party API allows **testing without billing** while maintaining compatibility with standard Google Maps route data.  

---

> **Note:** Debug APK is provided to ensure all map and directions features work **out-of-the-box** for evaluation.
